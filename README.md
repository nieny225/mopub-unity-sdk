## New in This Version  (5.6.0 - March 21, 2019)
- The MoPub Unity Plugin now includes versions 5.6.0 of the MoPub Android SDK and the MoPub iOS SDK.
- The MoPub iOS SDK is now included via podspecs.
- Android application pause events are now properly handled.
- isSDKInitialized on Android now returns true only after SDK initalization has completed.

Please view the [MoPub Unity SDK changelog](https://github.com/mopub/mopub-unity-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), [MoPub Android SDK changelog](https://github.com/mopub/mopub-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), and [MoPub iOS SDK changelog](https://github.com/mopub/mopub-ios-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for a complete list of additions, fixes, and enhancements across releases and platforms.

## Upgrading to SDK 5.6

Starting in MoPub Unity Plugin 5.6, the MoPub iOS SDK is no longer included as a bundled framework and is instead specified as a dependency via podspecs. Upgrading from previous versions will leave the previously bundled iOS SDK framework, which needs to be removed to avoid collisions with the podspec dependency.

To address this, please delete the following directory from your project prior to building for iOS with the MoPub Unity Plugin 5.6: Assets/MoPub/Plugins/iOS/MoPubSDKFramework.framework

## Upgrading to SDK 5.4

Starting in MoPub Unity Plugin 5.4, the SDK Manager (opened via the previously-beta MoPub menu) automatically detects if there are directories or files in the legacy plugin structure, and displays a “Migrate” button.
NOTE: Performing the migration is optional as it simply organizes all MoPub code within the same directory, and doing it (or not) should not have any adverse effect.

for more details, see https://developers.mopub.com/docs/unity/getting-started/#migrating-to-54

## Upgrading to SDK 5.0

Please see the [Getting Started Guide](https://developers.mopub.com/docs/unity/getting-started/) for instructions on upgrading from SDK 4.X to SDK 5.0.

For GDPR-specific upgrading instructions, also see the [GDPR Integration Guide](https://developers.mopub.com/docs/publisher/gdpr-guide/).

## Developing on the MoPub Unity Plugin

### Cloning the project
```
git clone https://github.com/mopub/mopub-unity-sdk
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

### Repository structure

* `mopub-android-sdk/` - Git submodule of the MoPub Android SDK
* `mopub-android-sdk-unity/` - Android wrapper, contains a project that adds Unity-specific files to the Android SDK
* `mopub-ios-sdk/` - Git submodule of the MoPub iOS SDK
* `unity-sample-app/Assets/MoPub/Plugins/iOS` - iOS wrapper code to interface with the iOS SDK
* `unity-sample-app/` - Contains MoPub Unity Plugin sample project
* `mopub-unity-plugin/` - Where the Unity packages are exported after running `./unity-export-package.sh`

### Prerequisities
Before you can build the plugin per the instructions below, you must do the following:
* Place any third-party SDKs and dependencies in their corresponding directories, per README files in:
  * `mopub-android-sdk-unity/libs/` - Android wrapper dependencies
  * `unity/MoPubUnityPlugin/Assets/Plugins/Android/` - Android plugin dependencies
  * iOS loads dependencies at runtime, so there's no need to add them prior to building
* Set up the Unity IDE:
  * Make sure you are logged in to your Unity account
  * Open the Unity Plugin project (under the `unity/` directory), open Build Settings and Switch Platform to either Android or iOS
  * Close the Unity IDE

### How do I build?

NOTE: Building is only needed for development of the MoPub Unity SDK; for MoPub SDK integration, please see our [Unity Engine Integration](https://www.mopub.com/resources/docs/unity-engine-integration/) guide.

Simply run [`./scripts/build.sh`](https://github.com/mopub/mopub-unity-sdk/blob/master/scripts/build.sh) (make sure the Unity IDE is *not* running), which builds the Android wrapper, copies it to the sample project, and then exports a unity package with everything needed for a successful MoPub integration.

Exporting the unity package can also be done manually, by opening the `unity/` project in Unity, right-clicking the `Assets/` folder and chosing `Export Package...`.

### How do I run the sample unity project and test?

After building per instructions above, open the `unity-sample-app/` project in Unity, click `File > Build Settings...`, select iOS or Android, click `Build and Run`.
